## Projects
## DNA Sequence Classification with Advanced ML Techniques
[View Results](https://github.com/Drichards124/DNA-Sequence/tree/main) (Github)

Utilized advanced machine learning techniques and neural network architectures, specifically a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, to decode and classify genetic sequences from a comprehensive DNA dataset. The project's goal was to map segments of DNA to their corresponding nucleotides meticulously—adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T)—with high accuracy and efficiency. Through rigorous preprocessing of biological data into a machine-readable format and meticulous training of the neural model, I leveraged the MLP's sophisticated pattern recognition capabilities to achieve this objective.

## Bank Customer Churn Prediction Using ANN and H2O AutoML
[View Results](https://github.com/Drichards124/bank-customer-churn-prediction.git) (Github)

Utilized Python to implement and compare two machine learning models, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and H2O's Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), to predict customer churn. Starting with comprehensive data analysis and feature engineering, I identified key factors contributing to customer turnover. I then constructed a tailored ANN model to detect intricate customer behaviors and an H2O AutoML ensemble model for robust prediction capabilities. I aimed to accurately classify and assign a probability to potential churn, enabling targeted and effective customer retention strategies. Through this methodical approach, I aimed to leverage the predictive power of machine learning to reduce customer churn.

## Location-Based Restaurant Recommendation System 
[View Results](https://github.com/Drichards124/location-based-recommendation-system.git) (Github)

Developed a location-based restaurant recommendation system using this [Yelp Dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3x1w789mmuae3ao/yelp_academic_dataset_business.zip). Key to this was the application of KMeans clustering, focusing on user reviews and geographical data. I employed Plotly and GeoPandas to visualize the spatial data effectively, enhancing the interpretability of the model. The project culminated in creating a function that recommends restaurants based on user-provided geographic coordinates, demonstrating my skills in leveraging machine learning and data visualization tools to derive practical, user-focused solutions.

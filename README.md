## Work Experience
**Data Analyst @ LendingPoint (_June 2023_ - _January 2024_)**
- Achieved a 79% reduction in SQL query slot usage (from 1,200 to 250) and reduced query execution time by 80% (from 20 minutes to 4 minutes), resulting in significantly improved data processing efficiency and resource utilization.
- Implemented a DOMO-based dashboard utilizing SQL tailored for the Vice President of Point Of Need, enabling real-time tracking of vendor funding and applications. This strategic initiative led to a substantial 23% reduction in fraudulent merchant applications. 
- Spearheaded the development of a master QA datasheet using BI tools, resulting in a 31% reduction in Full-Time Equivalent hours. This enabled data visibility and change impact analysis for non-SQL users across the project management team and interested executives/stakeholders. 

**Customer Service @ LendingPoint (_August 2021_ - _June 2023_)**
- Managed 100+ daily customer inquiries with care, empathy, and effective problem-solving, resulting in increased loyalty and a 4.9/5 customer satisfaction rating over 30,000 calls.
- Collaborated closely with team members to collectively develop and implement best practices for consistent and exceptional customer service delivery, fostering a culture of excellence.
- Adapted to feedback, implemented effective strategies, and consistently exceeded performance metrics, earning recognition as a top performer. These experiences have equipped me with valuable skills to excel in roles such as Data Analytics.

## Projects
**DNA Sequence Classification with Advanced ML Techniques** | [View Results](https://github.com/Drichards124/DNA-Sequence/tree/main) (Github)

Utilized advanced machine learning techniques and neural network architectures, specifically a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, to decode and classify genetic sequences from a comprehensive DNA dataset. The project's goal was to map segments of DNA to their corresponding nucleotides meticulously—adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T)—with high accuracy and efficiency. Through rigorous preprocessing of biological data into a machine-readable format and meticulous training of the neural model, I leveraged the MLP's sophisticated pattern recognition capabilities to achieve this objective.

**Location-Based Restaurant Recommendation System** | [View Results](https://github.com/Drichards124/location-based-recommendation-system.git) (Github)

Developed a location-based restaurant recommendation system using this [Yelp Dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3x1w789mmuae3ao/yelp_academic_dataset_business.zip). Key to this was the application of KMeans clustering, focusing on user reviews and geographical data. I employed Plotly and GeoPandas for effective visualization of the spatial data, enhancing the interpretability of the model. The project culminated in creating a function that recommends restaurants based on user-provided geographic coordinates, demonstrating my skills in leveraging machine learning and data visualization tools to derive practical, user-focused solutions.

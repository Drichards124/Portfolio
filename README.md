## Work Experience
**Data Analyst @ LendingPoint (_June 2023_ - _January 2024_)**
- Achieved a 79% reduction in SQL query slot usage (from 1,200 to 250) and reduced query execution time by 80% (from 20 minutes to 4 minutes), resulting in significantly improved data processing efficiency and resource utilization.
- Implemented a DOMO-based dashboard utilizing SQL tailored for the Vice President of Point Of Need, enabling real-time tracking of vendor funding and applications. This strategic initiative led to a substantial 23% reduction in fraudulent merchant applications. 
- Spearheaded the development of a master QA datasheet using BI tools, resulting in a 31% reduction in Full-Time Equivalent hours. This enabled data visibility and change impact analysis for non-SQL users across the project management team and interested executives/stakeholders.

**Location-Based Restaurant Recommendation System** | [View Results] (Github)
Developed a location-based restaurant recommendation system using this [Yelp Dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3x1w789mmuae3ao/yelp_academic_dataset_business.zip). Key to this was the application of KMeans clustering, focusing on user reviews and geographical data. I employed Plotly and GeoPandas for effective visualization of the spatial data, enhancing the interpretability of the model. The project culminated in creating a function that recommends restaurants based on user-provided geographic coordinates, demonstrating my skills in leveraging machine learning and data visualization tools to derive practical, user-focused solutions.
